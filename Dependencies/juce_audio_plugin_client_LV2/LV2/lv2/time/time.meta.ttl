	lv2:documentation """

This is a vocabulary for describing a position in time and the speed of time
passage, in both real and musical terms.

In addition to real time (based on seconds), two units of time are used:
_frames_ and _beats_.  A frame is a numbered quantum of time.  Frame time is
related to real-time by the _frame rate_ or _sample rate_,
time:framesPerSecond.  A beat is a single pulse of musical time.  Beat time is
related to real-time by the _tempo_, time:beatsPerMinute.

Musical time additionally has a _meter_ which describes passage of time in
terms of musical _bars_.  A bar is a higher level grouping of beats.  The meter
describes how many beats are in one bar.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

time:Position
	lv2:documentation """

A point in time and/or the speed at which time is passing.  A position is both
a point and a speed, which precisely defines a time within a timeline.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

time:Rate
	lv2:documentation """

The rate of passage of time in terms of one unit with respect to another.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

time:beat
	lv2:documentation """

This is not the beat within a bar like time:barBeat, but relative to the same
origin as time:bar and monotonically increases unless the transport is
repositioned.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

time:beatUnit
	lv2:documentation """

Beat unit, the note value that counts as one beat.  This is the bottom number
in a time signature: 2 for half note, 4 for quarter note, and so on.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

time:speed
	lv2:documentation """

The rate of the progress of time as a fraction of normal speed.  For example, a
rate of 0.0 is stopped, 1.0 is rolling at normal speed, 0.5 is rolling at half
speed, -1.0 is reverse, and so on.
