This extension defines a feature, rsz:resize, which allows plugins to
dynamically resize their output port buffers.

In addition to the dynamic feature, there are properties which describe the
space required for a particular port buffer which can be used statically in
data files.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

rsz:resize
	lv2:documentation """

A feature to resize output port buffers in LV2_Plugin_Descriptor::run().

To support this feature, the host must pass an LV2_Feature to the plugin's
instantiate method with URI LV2_RESIZE_PORT__resize and a pointer to a
LV2_Resize_Port_Resize structure.  This structure provides a resize_port
function which plugins may use to resize output port buffers as necessary.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

rsz:asLargeAs
	lv2:documentation """

Indicates that a port requires at least as much buffer space as the port with
the given symbol on the same plugin instance.  This may be used for any ports,
but is generally most useful to indicate an output port must be at least as
large as some input port (because it will copy from it).  If a port is
asLargeAs several ports, it is asLargeAs the largest such port (not the sum of
those ports' sizes).

The host guarantees that whenever an ObjectPort's run method is called, any
output `O` that is rsz:asLargeAs an input `I` is connected to a buffer large
enough to copy `I`, or `NULL` if the port is lv2:connectionOptional.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

rsz:minimumSize
	lv2:documentation """

Indicates that a port requires a buffer at least this large, in bytes.  Any
host that supports the resize-port feature MUST connect any port with a
minimumSize specified to a buffer at least as large as the value given for this
property.  Any host, especially those that do NOT support dynamic port
resizing, SHOULD do so or reduced functionality may result.
